## Input data
- unsigned char byte1, byte2, byte3, byte4.
## Output data
- Binary representation of an unsigned integer made up from 4 bytes;
- Four bytes recreated from binary representation of an unsigned integer.
## Positive tests

- Simple test: four `1`;
- Max value `255` presents as a byte value;
- Simple test: four `0`;
- Simple test: four `255`.
