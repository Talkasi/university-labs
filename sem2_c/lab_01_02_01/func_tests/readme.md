## Input data
- double a, b, angle_val: **_bases of the trapezoid, the smallest angle_**;
## Output data
- double s: **_area of the trapezoid_**;
## Positive tests
- First base is bigger than the second;
- First base is bigger than the second, values are different from the previous test;
- First base is lower than the second;
- First base is lower than the second, values are different from the previous test.
## Negative tests
- The trapezoid doesn't exist;
- The angle is lower than zero;
- The angle is bigger than 90;
- The base of the trapezoid is 0 or less;
- One of the parameters is not a number;
- File is empty.
